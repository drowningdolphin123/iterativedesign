Commit #1: Bare Bones, most elements included.
(Almost) All images necessary are included. Waiting on initial sketch for emergencies and talking to vet, as well as working on thinking of creative way to display the links for the user test videos. Lots of CSS to work on still! Also need some descriptions for the initial sketches.

Commit #2: Some small edits.
Absolutely exhausted rn so leaving this for the morning. Nav bar is not sticky and I can't figure out why rn, but I think that could ultimately be a cool feature. If it doesn't work, though, we should make  left-side small column with options of places to jump? or we can just force people to scroll. kinda like jumping though. CSS mentioned earlier still not fixed, but will do later.

Commit #3: Adding README timeline.
Self explanatory ;)
