# iterativedesign
## Commit #1: Bare Bones, most elements included.

(Almost) All images necessary are included. Waiting on initial sketch for emergencies and talking to vet, as well as working on thinking of creative way to display the links for the user test videos. Lots of CSS to work on still! Also need some descriptions for the initial sketches.

## Commit #2: Some small edits.

Absolutely exhausted rn so leaving this for the morning. Nav bar is not sticky and I can't figure out why rn, but I think that could ultimately be a cool feature. If it doesn't work, though, we should make  left-side small column with options of places to jump? or we can just force people to scroll. kinda like jumping though. CSS mentioned earlier still not fixed, but will do later.

## Commit #3: Adding README timeline.
Self explanatory ;)

## Commit #4: Making it pretty (hopefully?)

1) Added in cards for user testing links. There are profile images and would like to have a quote from each user about our product underneath each one. Will eventually make it so the links don't actually turn purple, but good enough for right now.

2) All original sketch images are in, as well as descriptions of the image/ what we were hoping to do with these. // TODO: make a description card for each page of the wireframe explaining where we got the ideas from, what we wanted to achieve, etc.

3) Another TODO: make the hifi section prettier. Unsure of how to approach that right now.

4) Sticky top section still not working, will continue to try an implement because I think it would look the cleanest, but might give up soon :P
